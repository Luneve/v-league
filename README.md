# V-League — Volunteer Management Platform

**A role-based web platform that connects volunteers with organizations, tracks participation through a league/season points system, and gives admins oversight of the entire ecosystem.**

---

## Problem / Solution / Impact

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | In Kazakhstan, volunteer coordination is fragmented — organizations post on social media, volunteers have no unified place to discover, apply, and track their service hours. |
| **Solution** | V-League is a three-role platform (Volunteer, Organization, Admin) where organizations publish opportunities, volunteers apply and earn points, and admins govern seasons and verify organizations. |
| **Impact** | Encourages youth volunteerism by gamifying participation (leagues: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum), providing verifiable completion records, and giving organizations a structured pipeline. |

| Volunteer feed with filters (city, category, date, points) | Vol | `src/app/(volunteer)/feed/` |
| Apply / withdraw with eligibility checks and capacity enforcement | Vol | `src/services/applications.ts`, RPC `fn_apply_to_opportunity` |
| Candidate management: accept / waitlist / reject / promote | Org | `src/app/(org)/org/opportunities/[id]/candidates/` |
| Completion marking (completed / no-show) with points & hours | Org | RPC `fn_mark_completion`, table `completion_records` |
| League system (Bronze→Platinum) with season points | Vol | `volunteer_profiles.league`, `volunteer_profiles.season_points` |
| Season management + automated rollover (pg_cron daily) | Admin | RPC `fn_start_season`, `fn_run_season_rollover`, cron job |

| Notifications (status changes, cancellations, completions) | All | table `notifications`, `src/lib/actions/notifications.ts` |
| Audit logging | Admin | table `audit_logs`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/audit/` |
| Configurable rules (penalties, promotion thresholds, caps) | Admin | table `config` (6 keys), `src/lib/actions/admin.ts` |
| Row-Level Security on every table (27 policies) | — | DB: 27 RLS policies across 11 tables |
| Cron: auto-close expired opportunities | — | `src/app/api/cron/close-expired/route.ts`, RPC `fn_close_expired_opportunities` |
| Dark/light theme | All | `next-themes`, `src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx` |

### Not Implemented / Out of Scope

- **Telegram bot** — not present in codebase
- **Certificate PDF generation** — upload endpoint exists (`src/lib/actions/certificates.ts`) but no auto-generation
- **Search / full-text search** — no search implementation
- **Automated tests** — no test files; SQL smoke tests exist in migration `20260218181046_smoke_tests`
- **i18n** — English UI only
- **AI/ML model** — no AI component; the project is a full-stack CRUD platform

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL> && cd v-league
# Create .env.local with: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, CRON_SECRET
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

**Database**: The project uses a hosted Supabase instance. All schema is managed via 40 migrations applied through the Supabase dashboard. No local `supabase/` CLI directory is present — migrations live in the Supabase cloud project.

**Demo accounts**: Create accounts via `/auth/register` selecting each role (volunteer, organization). An admin account must be manually set in the `profiles` table (`role = 'admin'`).

## Demo Scenarios (end-to-end)

### Flow 1: Volunteer Journey
1. Register as volunteer → redirected to `/feed`
2. Browse open opportunities → apply (with optional message)
3. View application status at `/applications`
4. Get accepted by org → notification appears
5. After event: org marks completion → points + hours awarded
6. Check leaderboard at `/leaderboard`

### Flow 2: Organization Journey
1. Register as organization → see "unverified" lock screen
2. Admin verifies org → lock lifts
3. Create opportunity (draft) → publish (open)
4. Review candidates → accept / waitlist / reject
5. After event: mark each accepted volunteer as completed or no-show
6. Close or complete the opportunity

### Flow 3: Admin Journey
1. Login as admin → `/admin/dashboard` (stats, pending verifications)
2. Verify/unverify organizations at `/admin/organizations`
3. Start a new season at `/admin/seasons`
4. View audit trail at `/admin/audit`
5. Update config (penalties, promotion rules) at dashboard
